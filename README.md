# VIT + GPT-2 Image Captioning and Search System

This repository offers a sophisticated Image Captioning system powered by Vision Transformers (ViT) combined with GPT-2 language model. Not only can it generate relevant captions for a given image, but it also allows searching through an image dataset using either textual queries or image-to-image search.

## Features

- **Image Captioning**: Generate descriptive captions for any given image.
- **Textual Image Search**: Find the most relevant images by querying in natural language.
- **Image-to-Image Search**: Input an image to find similar images in the dataset.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SainadhAmul/Image-Captioning-and-Search.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Image-Captioning-and-Search
```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook ViT + GPT 2 model based Image Search.ipynb
```

2. Execute the cells in sequence to initialize the models, preprocess your dataset, and utilize the captioning and search functionalities.
3. (Optional) Modify, extend, and play around with the code to tailor it to your specific needs!

## Results
